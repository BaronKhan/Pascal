Pascal
=============

*Pascal* is a personal assistant and room automation system. Similar to Google Home and Amazon Echo,
it is capable of controlling devices in the room, as well as providing small talk and various bits of
information that the user asks. It is named after the machine from the video game, *NieR: Automata*.

Say "Pascal", followed by a query, such as a greeting, a question, or a command. Uses the snowboy API for
wakeup word detection, Houndify for the voice request, and gTTs for the voice audio output.

Uses a 433MHz RF transmitter to toggle the connected devices, such as lamps, light bulbs, fans, etc.
