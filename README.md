Room automation system. Similar to Google Home and Amazon Echo; capable of controlling devices in the room.
Named after the machine from the video game, *NieR: Automata*.

Say "Pascal", followed by a query, such as a greeting, a question, or a command. Uses the snowboy API for
wakeup word detection, Houndify for the voice request, and gTTs for the voice audio output.

Uses a 433MHz RF transmitter to toggle the connected devices, such as lamps, light bulbs, fans, etc.
